      Version Control. Writing code can get very complicated, and sometimes mistakes are made. If you make a piece of bad code you don't want your original work to be ruined. This is where version control comes in. Version control allows to to commit, or save a snapshot of your current state of code. If you make a mistake, go back. If you are happy with the new code, you can keep and merge it with your original, master code.

        Git helps you keep track of changes by using branches. A branch is a sort of journey you take while modifying code. If the journey is successful, you can merge with the master path, otherwise you can delete it. Additionally, git allows you go go back and forth through the different snapshos of code (commits) you have taken with simple commands like HEAD^.

        GitHub is an excellent place to store code. IT has a user-friendly interface and will store all of your code for free. You can share code with others (push) and others can share code with you (pull). This makes GitHub a very easy place to upload your work and share it with others.
