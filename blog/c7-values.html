The value I have selected is fairness. I think at their base, most other values come down to fairness. I think that the greatest gains in the world can be achieved by making the world more fair. I do have a distinct idea of what fairness is though. To me, fairness is treating people the same and helping everyone regardless of skill level.</p>

    The last topic someone asked me for advice on was Math. I am a math teacher, and my job is to help students learn math. This did not have to do with nay of my values but I do try to treat my students fairly. Often, at my school well behaved students will be ignored because they aren't 'a problem' but I try to make sure to help everyone.    </p>

  I think my values can help mitigate stereotype threat. Since I believe that everyone should be treated the same, there is no reason to treat others or have others treat me differently because of any particular skill or attribute that I have. If I begin to feel steretotype threat at DBC I plan to simply focus on the work and prove that I can handle it. Deep down I do believe I can and it is simply a matter of focusing and putting in the time required. In the past, I have read certain books which calm me down and put my struggles in perspective. I plan on reading a few pages of them each day to help my mood.
