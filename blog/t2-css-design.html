      IDs and classes are both used in CSS for somewhat similar purposes. Above is an example of using a class. A class is used to modify an element in an HTML file and can be used on multiple elements. Additionally, several classes can be used to modify one element.

IDs are more specific. They are made and used for only one element. You cannot use more than one ID on an element, nor can you use an ID more than once.

        IDs and Classes are similar in their ability to modify and element. In this area they have the same functionality. Neither IDs nor classes have default values, which means the creator (you) must assign them values.
