      IDs and Classes are two different ways to modify text in an HTML file through CSS. While they are often taught together, there are some distinct and important differences. You can think of an ID as a custom tailored suit. The suit is made for only one person and if that person is wearing it, they won't be wearing another custom suit at the same time. A class is more like a t-shirt. Anyone can wear it and a person can wear more than one (like an undershirt).

    <p>
        A Class is flexible. You can use multiple classes on the same element and use the same class on multiple elements. For instance, if you have a class which makes the text large, you can select which text you want large and assign it a particular class. As you can see above, to assign a class in the CSS file you type $ .<"class"> {
          "add changes"
      }

    <p>
        IDs are more specific than classes. IDs are only used once, and are created to affect a certain piece of your HTML file. Additionally, only 1 ID can be used per element. Howver, combining an ID and a Class on an element is allowed.

      <p> 
        Both IDs and Classes are used to select a particular part of your HTML file and modify it with CSS. Neither has a default command, which means when you name the new Class or ID you must assign it to do something. Whatever you assign it to do, either a Class or ID can do it, they have the ability to modify elements in the same way.
