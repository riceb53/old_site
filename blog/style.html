        After taking the Gregorc Thingking Style quiz, I am clearly labeled as an Abstract Sequential thinker. I chose that category on 13 of the 15 questions, far more than any other category. According to  Gregorc, this means that I want my point to be heard and I prefer to analyze a situation before making a decision. I am supposed to learn best with access to experts, and struggle with repeating the same tasks over and over again.

        This learning style has been significant in my development as a DBC member. While I think almost everyone prefers to analyze a situation before making a decision, I have always relied on experts to guide my learning. This usually came in the form of a techer or professor, and occasionally other students. At DBC, the learning is much more self guided. I have access to my cohort and Google, but I don't have an expert sitting next to me to guide me through the process. While I beleive in the "learn through doing" model, I am not experienced enough with it to use it most effectively. I hope that over time I will adjust.

        The biggest struggle for me so far has been feedback. While working, I often do not know if I am on the right track or wildly off. The terminal can help a bit by diagnosing errors but I am often left sitting at my computer saying to myself "So, am I completely lost with what I'm trying to accomplish here or did I just forget to put end at the end of a loop?" I eventually will figure it out but it can be very tedious. In one of the challenges I felt very confident in my answer but was getting all errors. After monkeying around with it for a bit with no success, I had decided that I did not understand the concept. After some Googling, I was using puts rather than return but everything else was correct. I think in the future when I feel confident about an answer a quick Google search could save me a lot of time.
