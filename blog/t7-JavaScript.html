Ruby is the first computer language I have spent any significant time learning. JavaScript will be the second. JavaScript and Ruby are both languages, but people feel very differently about the. My cousin calls JavaScript "the stupid language" and many people praise Ruby's readability. While JavaScript's syntax is more difficult, I found the two languages somewhat similar. I felt like I was trying to learn French when I already knew Spanish. The languages are somewhat related. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to evaluate this 'relatedness' is to compare Ruby Hashes to JavaScript Objects. While everything in Ruby is classified as an object, the term object in JavaScript is used more specifically. In practice, both Hashes and Objects create a similar data structure. Both are created to store data in pairs. In Hashes, these are valled key and value. In Objects, keys are the same but there is no name for the 'value'.
    </p>
   <p>
    Creating these data types is also suprisingly similar. To create the empty Hash q in Ruby type "q = {}". To create the object q in JavaScript type "var q = {}";. The only difference is that you have to identify q as a new variable in JavaScript and you don't have to in Ruby.
   </p>

    <p>
One other way Hashes and Objects are different is the way you delete information from them. Both have the method 'delete' which will remove the key and value from the Hash or Object. If the Hash or Object is named q and key is named "t", in Ruby deleting something would look like <p>

    </p>
    q.delete("b")
 <p>
  <p>
  In JavaScript, it would look like     
    </p>
     <p>
      delete q.t
    </p>

    <p>
      The logic is the same in both. For JavaScript, the method goes before and in Ruby the method goes after. Not a huge difference. It reminds me of the different descriptions in Spanish and English. In English I would say "Blue shirt" but in Spanish I would say "Camiseta azul" which translates literally to shirt blue. Overall, the two languages differ, but I feel that I am learning a new dialect rather than a new language.
