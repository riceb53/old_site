Looking through Stack Overflow's “How do I ask a good question?” page, I realize how good the typical question on there is. Of course, the results I am looking at are from the first few results on Google, so those would tend to be the questions of higher quality and have responses. I learned a lot while looking through the guidelines. The first thing I realized was that the questions are extremely specific. This helps both parties. If a question is vague, the answer may not be relevant to the person asking the question. Additionally, from the perspective of someone who might answer the question, it is much more difficult to accurately answer a question that is vague.

Another aspect which I had not thought of before would be the importance of a title. Similar to the way one uses a catchy title to rise in Google searches, a straightforward title will help others notice your post and answer it accurately and rapidly. A good tip from Stack Overflow says to write your post first and then summarize with a title. This is good advice for other writing as well.

Including tags is another way to help your question to be answered. People with knowledge of those tags will be more likely to find your question, and tagged questions can help your question be discovered more easily by searching. The crucial takeaway is to include all relevant information without bombarding other readers with your entire program.

  I think that the questions I ask in my daily life are much different from asking a question on Stack Overflow. Face-to-face, the other person is engaged with you and has decided to help (usually). Stack Overflow is a different story, and as the person asking the question you must stand out from the crowd. Since many other people are having issues, you must draw the attention of someone else through the clarity of your message, and ideally get a straightforward answer.

  The simple way to improve questions the most is to think from the perspective of the person who will eventually answer your question. On-line, people are not being paid to answer your question they must do so out of the kindness of their heart, so you must make it easier for them. Write your question, post your relevant code and then create a concise title. This should allow your post to be found and answered by whichever online community you are posting on.
