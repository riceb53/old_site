  <h1>Online Security</h1>
  <h2>What can we do to keep our data safe?</h2>

      Last month, it was revealed that hackers stole data from about 21.5 million people, many of whom work for the U.S. Government. In that data were nearly 20 million security clearance applications. This follows a similar eBay breach where the company asked each of its 145 million users to change their passwords so that their data would be kept safe. These breaches can move tech back in many ways. First, since a well publicized breach is so costly, technology companies must move more resources to security which means fewer resources for other parts of business. Second, people who are on the margin of using technology will be less likely to so which hurts the entire industry. Third, companies may be liable for damages caused by stolen information. If this is the case, any company could potentially go bankrupt if their security is compromised, which would redirect companies away from producing quality products and toward security. Of course, security is good, but it should not be the main focus of every single tech company.

        Finding solutions to this problem will be difficult. Defending against a security breach is very difficult because it needs to happen only once for security to be a failure. The potential hackers can try every day for 5 years and fail but if they suceed for 5 minutes the security is deemed weak. Of course, if security is never compromised no one even thinks about it. In the security game, one only gets attention if they lose.

       One option would be to simply spend a lot more on security measures. Companies could continuously update security measures and change processes often enough that hackers would not be able to crack the security before it changes. This would be unpleasant for both the company and the workers. The company would have to divert significant resources to a threat that may or may not exist at the expense of their core operations. Employees would also become frustrated because they would have to deal with frequently changing security procedures.

      Another possible solution would be to bring the battle to the hackers. A company could assign a small group of people to be proactive against hackers and disrupt their operations before the attack. This would have several problems, however. The personnel at a large company are probably not as adept at hacking as professional hackers. They may be outmatched. Second, attempting to disrupt hackers may bring more attention to that company and bring more attacks. Finally, hacking anyone is illegal. While shadowy people on the internet can try to hack a large company with few repercussions, the converse is not true.

      Currently, the best solution would upset many people as well. Large companies could work together to hire a small team of quality hackers to protect them all. This way, no company would become a target and resources could be pooled for the best personnel. This small group could work with government agencies to avoid legal trouble and find potential hackers.

    <p>
      The idea of a small group of hackers paid by large tech companies would probably bother a lot of people, both in and out of the tech industry. However, as more and more people have their information stolen the idea will become accepted.
