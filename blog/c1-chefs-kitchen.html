      I cannot tell if the DBC experience will be helpful for true beginners. The experience rebels against traditional schooling which is to memorize facts and use them appropriately. I am currently a teacher and my style changes based on the students I teach. For my beginner classes, I focus on basic skills so students can somewhere to build on. In my more advanced classes, I rely on the ingenuity of the students to solve problems they have not faced before. The second method is more aligned with DBC culture. Students are to be somewhat self-sufficient by using their work ethic to find solutions for themselves.

        I think that this culture will be successful for nearly all students, including myself. Before interacting with the DBC cultural materials, I assumed that there would be tiers of students like there are at any educational institution. I think at DBC the curriculum will be so rapid that no one will be too far ahead.

        I am excited to be a part of a positive-sum environment. As students learn we can help each other and become better programmers as well as teachers and people. I am looking forward to it.
