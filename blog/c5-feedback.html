Pairing has been one of the pleasant surprises in my experience with DBC so far. Often, the only feedback while coding is "12 Tests, 8 failures" which can be tedious after awhile. Since each of us is coming from a different place, we all have different strengths and weaknesses. This makes pairing fun and interesting. I have learned a bit about my cohort while also learning programming tricks and tips. Having a pair is also extremely useful while refactoring. Often, the two people will g about solving the problem in two totally different ways. This is much harder with only one brain. The only difficult part has been in getting to know my pair. It is inherently difficult to work with someone for the first time on somethingneither of you are experts in. Findding a rhythm can be challenging, especially at the very beginning because each person has his or her own style. That said, it has been remarkably easy considering the situation.

      I heard somewhere that for balance, 3 compliments must be given for every negative piece of feedback. After reading my feedback, I agree with that idea. While reading my feedback, I realized how fragile my ego is with regard to programming. With each minor compliment, my confidence soared and with each criticism my confidnce sank. This is especially difficult because the feedback is given in print, so the tone has as much to do with the other person's writing style as it does with their true meaning. Five minutes after reading it, I reflected on the struture of the feedback in Socrates. The structure must be this way in order for near-strangers to rate each other. Requiring constructive criticism is necessary because people will often be too shy/afraid to give critical advice.

      The feedback I received was on topics I know I struggle with already, specifically organizing my code. This comes from the fact that I try to just "get it working" which usually means I work too quickly. While I did know this before, it really drives the point home when I hear it from someone else.

      Writing feedback was not challenging. I give (and receive) feedback constantly to students who have a very fragile sense of self: high school students. I have learned how to praise and critique without being too harsh. The  most difficult part of writing feedback was the specific part of the A.S.K. method. I often wait a few days after the pairing session to give feedback, and my memory sometimes fails me. I typically remember the session as pleasnat and helpful but finding a specific instance of something positive or negative can be a challenge for me. Overall, pairing has been a very pleasant experience so far at DBC.
