When I first began teaching, I co-taught with a history teacher. My liscense was a special education generalist so I was teaching everything from Global History to Environmental Science. As a brand new teacher I knew little about the subject matter, the students or teaching in general. This made it difficult to pull my weight, especially because my coteacher was so outgoing. At the beginning of the year, he taught nearly all of the material and I felt useless. Additionally, he felt that I was 'being lazy'.    </p>
    <p>
After analyzing the conflict, I realized that I felt a lack of control. On one level, I felt an immense responsibility to provide a quality education. However, my skills were severely lacking and I was not getting an opportunity to work on my skills. I wanted to work on my skills and teach my students, and wasn't able to do either. I felt like I was just a passenger on a ride, rather than a driver.

One day when my coteacher made a comment about me not pulling my own weight we had a fruitful talk. I explained my position and he did not realize how unfamiliar I was with the material. He helped me learn the material better and we each defined clear roles. I would start and end the class with small assignments while he would do much of the lecturing in the middle. This allowed each of us to contribute while still providing the students with the higher quality content knowledge from the history teacher.

  If I could go back, I would have been much clearer from the outset. I was brand new and didn't want others to think I was underqualified, stupid or useless. Since my coteacher and I did not know each other's strengths and weaknesses, we couldn't plan our class effectively.
</p>     
<p> Overall, I learned that having open conversations with coworkers is worthwhile. Generally, everyone is moving toward the same goal and i is helpful for everyone to know the skills of one another. Of course, over time those skills change and adjustments mus be made, but getting everyone on the same page is very valuable.
