      Stereotype threat has to do with the affect of negative stereotypes on the performance of an individual, and in particular in an academic environment. When negative stereotypes exist for a group that someone is a part of, that person can internalize those stereotypes and perform in the way that the stereotype says. At first this seems like a way to explain away any stereotype. "This group acts in a certain way because other people expect it". That is, stereotypes are true because the stereotype existed in the first place.

The research shows very clearly that this is not the case. When students are asked to identify themselves as a certain group before a test, their results are worse than average. However, when students do not identify as that group, their results are on par with everyone else. Just to state that again, if someone is reminded that they are in a group with a negative stereotype they actually perform worse on tests. With this finding, it is surprising that the SAT would still have students fill that information out right before the exam.

While I have not been impacted by stereotype threat often, it happened when I was in college. I transferred from a less selective college to a more selective college after my Sophomore year. I assumed that the students would be much harder working and intelligent (they were). Often, I felt that I did not have the rigorous foundational courses that my classmates did and that I was at a disadvantage.

My stereotype threat was most severe at the beginning of each semester. I would see students I didn't know, a professor who was well regarded in his field and I would not know if I could hack it. The threat subsided over the course of the semester, usually after the results of the first test. Seeing objectively where I was in the class helped me realize I belonged.

  The research and my experience are at odds. The research says I would do worse on the test because of stereotype threat but in fact the test results reduced my stereotype threat. There are a few possibilities that could allow for the research to match my experience. One is that I would have done even better on the tests without the stereotype. I have no idea if that is true, but I suspect it is not. Another could be that I interacted with my classmates before the test and was accepted by them which reduced my threat level enough to still perform well on the tests.

    My experience is just one data point, so my advice to reduce for those trying to reduce it would be this: try to be a part of the group. Once you talk to people who you think may be superior, you will realize that they are not. Once the spell is broken, stereotypes will have less of an effect on you.
