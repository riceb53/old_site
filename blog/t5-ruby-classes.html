The picture above shows how to make a  somewhat useful Ruby class. Creating a class is a bit different from creating a method, and is used differently. A class is created with a capital letter.Classes are objects that hold methods. These methods can only be used on objects in those classes. Creating an instance of the class I created would be as easy as "pringles = Cylinder.new".

    </p>
    <p>
      Creating methods inside classes is a bit different than doing so otherwise. Once the shell of the class is created, one must initialize instance variables. In my class, Cylinder, I initialized both height and radius. While inside the class, use these instance variables. Instance variables always begin with the "@" sign and are only used within the class they are created in. However, instance variables can be used in any methods created within that class.
    </p>
    <p>
    An instance method is like any other method except that it can be used only by members of that class. This is true of previously created classes like strings and arrays.  
    </p>

    <p>
      It may seem strange to only want methods available to certain classes but it does make sense. For instance, I cannot call the "pop" method on a string but I am able to on an array. While "pop" removes the last element in an array, that cannot be done on a string (it doesn't have elements the way an array does). So by creating new methods for use only in the new class, each method has a specific and useful purpose. For me, that is calculating the surface area and volume of any cylinder given the height and radius.
